# SE-IngameScripts
A collection of my Ingame scripts for Keen Software House's game Space Engineers.  
Note that these are modular scripts, which means you can "merge" them together in one PB.  
All scripts are ready to use, just strap them in a PB and run.  

# Script Listing

# Bug reports/Suggestions
If you found any bugs/issues, you can either head over to the script's Steam page and report there, or open an Issue here.  
If you have any suggestion, you can open a PR.
